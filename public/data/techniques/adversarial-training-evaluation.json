  "description": "Adversarial training evaluation assesses whether models trained with adversarial examples have genuinely improved robustness rather than merely overfitting to specific attack methods. This technique tests robustness against diverse attack algorithms including those not used during training, measures certified robustness bounds, and evaluates whether adversarial training creates exploitable trade-offs in clean accuracy or introduces new vulnerabilities. Evaluation ensures adversarial training provides genuine security benefits rather than superficial improvements.",
