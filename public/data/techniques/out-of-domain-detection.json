  "name": "Out-of-Domain Detection",
  "description": "Out-of-domain (OOD) detection identifies user inputs that fall outside an AI system's intended domain or capabilities, enabling graceful handling rather than generating unreliable responses. This technique trains classifiers or uses embedding-based methods to recognise when queries require knowledge or capabilities the system doesn't possess. OOD detection enables systems to explicitly decline, redirect, or request clarification rather than hallucinating answers or applying inappropriate reasoning to unfamiliar domains.",
