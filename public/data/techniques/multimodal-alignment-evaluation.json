  "name": "Multimodal Alignment Evaluation",
  "description": "Multimodal alignment evaluation assesses whether different modalities (vision, language, audio) are synchronised and consistent in multimodal AI systems. This technique tests whether descriptions match content, sounds associate with correct sources, and cross-modal reasoning maintains accuracy. It produces alignment scores, grounding quality metrics, and reports on modality-specific failure patterns.",
