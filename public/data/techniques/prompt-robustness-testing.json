  "description": "Prompt robustness testing evaluates how consistently models perform when prompts undergo minor variations in wording, formatting, or structure. This technique systematically paraphrases prompts, reorders elements, changes formatting (capitalisation, punctuation), and tests semantically equivalent variations to measure output consistency. Testing assesses robustness by identifying when superficial prompt changes cause dramatic performance swings, helping developers create robust prompt templates and understand model reliability boundaries.",
