  "name": "Model Extraction Defence Testing",
  "description": "Model extraction defence testing evaluates protections against attackers who attempt to steal model functionality by querying it and training surrogate models. This technique assesses defences like query limiting, output perturbation, watermarking, and fingerprinting by simulating extraction attacks and measuring how much model functionality can be replicated. Testing evaluates both the effectiveness of defences in preventing extraction and their impact on legitimate use cases, ensuring security measures don't excessively degrade user experience.",
