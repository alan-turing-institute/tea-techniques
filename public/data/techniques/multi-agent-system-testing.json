  "description": "Multi-agent system testing evaluates safety and reliability of systems where multiple AI agents interact, coordinate, or compete. This technique assesses emergent behaviours, communication protocols, conflict resolution, and whether agents maintain objectives appropriately. Testing produces reports on agent interaction patterns, coalition formation, failure cascade analysis, and safety property violations in multi-agent scenarios.",
