  "name": "AI Agent Safety Testing",
  "description": "AI agent safety testing evaluates autonomous AI agents that interact with external tools, APIs, and systems to ensure they operate safely and as intended. This technique assesses whether agents correctly understand tool specifications, respect usage constraints, handle errors gracefully, avoid unintended side effects, and make safe decisions during multi-step reasoning. Testing includes boundary condition validation (extreme parameters, edge cases), permission verification (ensuring agents don't exceed authorized actions), and cascade failure analysis (how tool errors propagate through agent workflows).",
