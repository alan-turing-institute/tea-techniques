  "name": "API Usage Pattern Monitoring",
  "description": "API usage pattern monitoring analyses AI model API usage to detect anomalies and generate evidence of secure operation. This technique tracks request patterns, input distributions, and usage velocity to produce security reports, anomaly detection evidence, and usage compliance documentation. Monitoring generates quantitative metrics on extraction attempt frequency, adversarial probing patterns, and deviation from intended use, creating auditable evidence for assurance cases.",
