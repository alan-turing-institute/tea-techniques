  "description": "Synthetic data evaluation assesses whether synthetic datasets protect individual privacy while maintaining statistical utility and fidelity to real data. This technique evaluates three key dimensions: privacy (through disclosure risk metrics and re-identification attack success rates), utility (by comparing statistical properties and model performance), and fidelity (measuring distributional similarity to real data). It produces evaluation reports quantifying the privacy-utility-fidelity trade-offs.",
