  "name": "Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness Evaluation",
  "description": "Chain-of-thought faithfulness evaluation assesses the quality and faithfulness of step-by-step reasoning produced by language models. This technique evaluates whether intermediate reasoning steps are logically valid, factually accurate, and actually responsible for final answers (rather than post-hoc rationalisations). Evaluation methods include consistency checking (whether altered reasoning changes answers), counterfactual testing (injecting errors in reasoning chains), and comparison between reasoning paths for equivalent problems to ensure systematic rather than spurious reasoning.",
