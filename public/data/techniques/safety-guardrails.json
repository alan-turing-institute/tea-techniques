  "description": "Safety guardrails apply real-time content moderation and safety constraints during deployment, generating evidence of safety violations and protection effectiveness. This technique produces detailed logs of blocked content, safety incident reports, violation pattern analysis, and guardrail performance metrics. Evidence includes categorised threat taxonomies, false positive/negative rates, and temporal trends in attack patterns, supporting assurance claims about deployed system safety.",
