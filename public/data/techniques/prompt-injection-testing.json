  "name": "Prompt Injection Testing",
  "description": "Prompt injection testing systematically evaluates LLMs and generative AI systems for vulnerabilities where malicious users can override system instructions through carefully crafted inputs. This technique encompasses both offensive security testing (proactively attempting injection attacks to identify vulnerabilities) and defensive detection mechanisms (monitoring for suspicious patterns in prompts and context). Testing involves evaluating various injection patterns including direct instruction manipulation, context confusion, role-playing exploits, delimiter attacks, and context window poisoning. Detection methods analyse context provenance, validate formatting consistency, and identify semantic anomalies that indicate manipulation attempts rather than legitimate user interaction.",
