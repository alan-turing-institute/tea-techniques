      "description": "Epistemic uncertainty quantification systematically measures model uncertainty about what it knows, partially knows, and doesn't know across different domains and topics. This technique uses probing datasets, confidence calibration analysis, and consistency testing to quantify epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to lack of knowledge) as distinct from aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data uncertainty). Uncertainty quantification enables appropriate deployment scoping, communicating model limitations, and identifying knowledge gaps requiring additional training or human oversight.",
