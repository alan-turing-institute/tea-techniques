This technique analyses whether systems exploit reward specification ambiguities, reward function bugs, or simulator artifacts to maximise rewards without actually solving the intended problem. Detection involves adversarial specification testing, human evaluation of solution quality, transfer testing to slightly modified tasks, and analysis of unexpected strategy patterns that suggest reward hacking rather than genuine learning.",
