It works by analysing how variables relate to each other, finding a smaller number of unobserved factors that explain patterns among multiple observed variables. Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

For example, instead of predicting 'average house price = £300,000', it can predict 'there's a 10% chance the price will be below £250,000, 50% chance below £300,000, and 90% chance below £380,000'. This technique reveals how input features affect different parts of the outcome distribution - perhaps property size strongly influences luxury homes (90th percentile) but barely affects budget properties (10th percentile). By capturing the full conditional distribution, quantile regression provides rich uncertainty information and enables robust prediction intervals.",

For example, in medical diagnosis, instead of saying 'likely cancer', it might say 'possible diagnoses: {cancer, benign tumour} with 95% confidence'.

By training several models on the same data with different starting points, the ensemble reveals how much the model's predictions depend on training randomness. The disagreement between ensemble members naturally indicates prediction uncertainty - when models agree, confidence is high; when they disagree, uncertainty is revealed. This approach provides more reliable uncertainty estimates, better out-of-distribution detection, and improved calibration compared to single models.",

The technique visualises attention weights as heatmaps showing how strongly each token attends to every other token across different heads and layers. By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",

The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features. This addresses not only direct discrimination but also indirect bias through correlated features. Practitioners can adjust a tuning parameter to balance between maintaining accuracy and removing prejudice from the model.",
