      "description": "Toxicity and bias detection uses automated classifiers and human review to identify harmful, offensive, or biased content in model outputs. This technique employs tools trained to detect toxic language, hate speech, stereotypes, and demographic biases through targeted testing with adversarial prompts. Detection covers explicit toxicity, implicit bias, and distributional unfairness across demographic groups.",
