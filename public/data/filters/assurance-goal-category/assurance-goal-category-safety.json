      "description": "ODIN (Out-of-Distribution Detector for Neural Networks) identifies when a neural network encounters inputs significantly different from its training distribution. It enhances detection by applying temperature scaling to soften the model's output distribution and adding small, carefully calibrated perturbations to the input that push in-distribution samples towards higher confidence predictions. By measuring the maximum softmax probability after these adjustments, ODIN can effectively distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs, flagging potentially unreliable predictions before they cause downstream errors.",

Applied to AI/ML systems, it serves as a continuous monitoring mechanism that can flag unexpected model predictions, suspicious input patterns, data drift, adversarial attacks, or operational malfunctions. By establishing baselines of normal system behaviour and alerting when deviations exceed predefined thresholds, organisations can detect potential security threats, model degradation, fairness violations, or system failures before they cause significant harm.",

This produces models that are faster, require less memory, and are often more interpretable whilst maintaining much of the original performance. Beyond compression, distillation can improve model reliability by regularising training and enable deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

This technique involves creating controlled perturbations of prompts whilst maintaining semantic meaning, then measuring how these changes influence model responses. It encompasses various types of prompt modifications including lexical substitutions, syntactic restructuring, formatting changes, and contextual variations. The analysis typically quantifies sensitivity through metrics such as output consistency, semantic similarity, and statistical measures of variance across prompt variations.",
