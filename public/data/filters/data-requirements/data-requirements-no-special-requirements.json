After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

The algorithm converts similarities between data points into joint probabilities in the high-dimensional space, then tries to minimise the divergence between these probabilities and those in the low-dimensional embedding. This approach excels at revealing cluster structures and local patterns, making it particularly effective for exploratory data analysis and understanding complex data relationships that linear methods like PCA might miss.",

This includes watermarking schemes that survive knowledge distillation, fingerprinting methods that create unique statistical signatures, and detection methods that identify when a model has been stolen or replicated through model extraction, distillation, or imitation. These techniques enable model owners to prove intellectual property theft and protect proprietary AI systems.",

This technique assesses whether agents correctly understand tool specifications, respect usage constraints, handle errors gracefully, avoid unintended side effects, and make safe decisions during multi-step reasoning. Testing includes boundary condition validation (extreme parameters, edge cases), permission verification (ensuring agents don't exceed authorized actions), and cascade failure analysis (how tool errors propagate through agent workflows).",
