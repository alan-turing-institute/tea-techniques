This technique uses dimensionality reduction, clustering analysis, and geometric fairness metrics to examine whether embeddings encode sensitive attributes, place certain groups in disadvantaged regions of representation space, or learn stereotypical associations. Analysis reveals whether embeddings used for retrieval, recommendation, or downstream tasks contain fairness issues that will propagate to applications.",
