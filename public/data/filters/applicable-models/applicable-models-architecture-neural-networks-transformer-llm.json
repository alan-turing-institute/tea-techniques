      "description": "Prompt Sensitivity Analysis systematically evaluates how variations in input prompts affect large language model outputs, providing insights into model robustness, consistency, and interpretability. This technique involves creating controlled perturbations of prompts whilst maintaining semantic meaning, then measuring how these changes influence model responses. It encompasses various types of prompt modifications including lexical substitutions, syntactic restructuring, formatting changes, and contextual variations. The analysis typically quantifies sensitivity through metrics such as output consistency, semantic similarity, and statistical measures of variance across prompt variations.",
