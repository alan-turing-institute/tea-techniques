The technique encompasses various approaches including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), statistical sampling methods, and privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy. Beyond privacy protection, synthetic data serves multiple purposes: augmenting limited datasets, balancing class distributions, testing model robustness, enabling data sharing across organisations, and supporting fairness assessments by generating representative samples for underrepresented groups.",
