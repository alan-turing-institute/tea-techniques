      "description": "Causal mediation analysis in language models is a mechanistic interpretability technique that systematically investigates how specific internal components (neurons, attention heads, or layers) causally contribute to model outputs. By performing controlled interventions—such as activating, deactivating, or modifying specific components—researchers can trace the causal pathways through which information flows and transforms within the model. This approach goes beyond correlation to establish causal relationships, enabling researchers to understand not just what features influence outputs, but how and why they do so through specific computational pathways.",

The technique visualises attention weights as heatmaps showing how strongly each token attends to every other token across different heads and layers. By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",
