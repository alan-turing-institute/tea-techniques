After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

This technique encompasses both offensive security testing (proactively attempting injection attacks to identify vulnerabilities) and defensive detection mechanisms (monitoring for suspicious patterns in prompts and context). Testing involves evaluating various injection patterns including direct instruction manipulation, context confusion, role-playing exploits, delimiter attacks, and context window poisoning. Detection methods analyse context provenance, validate formatting consistency, and identify semantic anomalies that indicate manipulation attempts rather than legitimate user interaction.",
