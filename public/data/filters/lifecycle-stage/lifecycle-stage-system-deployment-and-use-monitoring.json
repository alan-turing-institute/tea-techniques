Applied to AI/ML systems, it serves as a continuous monitoring mechanism that can flag unexpected model predictions, suspicious input patterns, data drift, adversarial attacks, or operational malfunctions. By establishing baselines of normal system behaviour and alerting when deviations exceed predefined thresholds, organisations can detect potential security threats, model degradation, fairness violations, or system failures before they cause significant harm.",

Testing involves evaluating various injection patterns including direct instruction manipulation, context confusion, role-playing exploits, delimiter attacks, and context window poisoning. Detection methods analyse context provenance, validate formatting consistency, and identify semantic anomalies that indicate manipulation attempts rather than legitimate user interaction.",
