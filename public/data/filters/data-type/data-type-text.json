Unlike simpler attribution methods, it separates the direct contribution of specific words or phrases from the contextual effects of surrounding words. This is particularly useful for understanding how sequential models process language, as it can identify whether a word's influence comes from its individual meaning or from its interaction with nearby words in the sequence.",

By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",

This technique employs tools trained to detect toxic language, hate speech, stereotypes, and demographic biases through targeted testing with adversarial prompts. Detection covers explicit toxicity, implicit bias, and distributional unfairness across demographic groups.",
